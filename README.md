The product that we are selling on our website is 3D printed models or parts for individuals or entrepreneurs. For example, an individual or entrepreneur might send a photo or sketch of an idea that they would like to be printed, and experts for the company can make a 3D model and send a proof to them for approval. Upon approval, the item or items will be shipped to them for a fee. Additionally, they could sent a CAD file of an object or part they would like printed (if they had prototyped a design and needed the ability to print it to test the shape or ergonomics, for example) and the company could print it and ship it out to them for testing.

3D printing technology has come a long way, and the cost of 3D printers has been reduced drastically in recent years, but good 3D printers can still cost a few hundred to a few thousand dollars depending on the size needed. For small businesses, solo entrepreneurs, or individuals, this cost may be too high and prohibit them from effectively prototyping or making products. Having the ability to only pay for what they need, without having to worry about buying a 3D printer, would be hugely beneficial to these demographics.
